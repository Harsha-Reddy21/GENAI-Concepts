# LLM Inference Scenario Analysis

## Scenario 1: Customer Support Chatbot

### Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds per message
- **Throughput**: 100 concurrent users
- **Cost Sensitivity**: Medium
- **Quality Needs**: Medium (must handle common queries accurately)

### Analysis

| Model | Hardware | Deployment | Results |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| 7B    | T4 GPU   | vLLM       | Latency: ~0.8s for 200 tokens<br>Memory: ~15GB (fits on T4)<br>Cost: ~$0.0002 per query<br>Can handle ~60 concurrent users |
| 13B   | A100 GPU | vLLM       | Latency: ~0.6s for 200 tokens<br>Memory: ~30GB (fits on A100)<br>Cost: ~$0.0005 per query (higher)<br>Can handle >100 concurrent users |
| GPT-4 | API      | OpenAI API | Latency: ~2s for 200 tokens<br>No memory concerns (API)<br>Cost: ~$0.006 per query (highest)<br>Unlimited concurrent users (API limits apply) |

### Recommendation
**Recommended Setup**: 7B model on multiple T4 GPUs with vLLM

**Rationale**:
- Meets response time requirements (~0.8s < 2s target)
- Cost-effective solution for medium cost sensitivity
- Can be scaled horizontally with multiple GPUs to meet throughput requirements
- Quality sufficient for standard customer support queries
- Deployment with vLLM optimizes throughput and latency

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use prompt templates to improve response quality
- Implement response caching for common queries
- Consider A100 upgrade if query complexity increases

## Scenario 2: Content Generation System

### Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 10 seconds acceptable
- **Throughput**: 20 concurrent users
- **Cost Sensitivity**: Low (quality prioritized)
- **Quality Needs**: High (creative, coherent long-form content)

### Analysis

| Model | Hardware | Deployment | Results |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| 7B    | T4 GPU   | vLLM       | Latency: ~4s for 1000 tokens<br>Memory: ~15GB (fits on T4)<br>Cost: ~$0.001 per generation<br>Quality: Limited creativity and coherence |
| 13B   | A100 GPU | vLLM       | Latency: ~3s for 1000 tokens<br>Memory: ~30GB (fits on A100)<br>Cost: ~$0.0025 per generation<br>Quality: Good balance of quality and cost |
| GPT-4 | API      | OpenAI API | Latency: ~8s for 1000 tokens<br>No memory concerns (API)<br>Cost: ~$0.03 per generation (highest)<br>Quality: Superior creative content |

### Recommendation
**Recommended Setup**: GPT-4 via API

**Rationale**:
- Quality is the priority for content generation
- Response time well within acceptable range (8s < 10s target)
- Lower throughput requirements make API costs manageable
- Superior creative capabilities justify the higher cost
- No infrastructure management overhead

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implement caching for similar requests
- Use streaming API to improve perceived latency
- Consider 13B model on A100 as a fallback if costs become prohibitive

## Scenario 3: Real-time Translation Service

### Requirements
- **Response Time**: < 500ms critical
- **Throughput**: 1000+ concurrent users
- **Cost Sensitivity**: High
- **Quality Needs**: Medium-high (accurate translations)

### Analysis

| Model | Hardware | Deployment | Results |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| 7B    | 4x T4 GPUs | ONNX     | Latency: ~300ms for short sentences<br>Memory: ~14GB per GPU<br>Cost: ~$0.0001 per translation<br>Quality: Acceptable for simple sentences only |
| 13B   | 2x A100 GPUs | TensorRT-LLM | Latency: ~200ms for short sentences<br>Memory: ~28GB per GPU<br>Cost: ~$0.0003 per translation (higher)<br>Quality: Good translation quality |
| GPT-4 | API      | OpenAI API | Latency: ~1-2s (too slow)<br>No memory concerns (API)<br>Cost: ~$0.002 per translation (highest)<br>Quality: Excellent translation quality |

### Recommendation
**Recommended Setup**: 13B model on multiple A100 GPUs with TensorRT-LLM

**Rationale**:
- Meets strict latency requirements (~200ms < 500ms target)
- TensorRT-LLM provides maximum optimization for NVIDIA hardware
- A100s provide necessary throughput for 1000+ concurrent users
- Quality sufficient for accurate translations
- Cost higher than 7B but justified by quality improvement

**Implementation Notes**:
- Implement load balancing across GPUs
- Use INT8 quantization to further optimize latency
- Consider specialized translation models as alternatives
- Deploy in multiple regions to reduce network latency
