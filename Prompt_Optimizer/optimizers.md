## Tool-Specific Optimization Strategies

The Adaptive Prompt Optimizer analyzes prompts and optimizes them based on the specific characteristics of different AI coding tools. Here's how the optimizations work for each tool:

### GitHub Copilot

- **Comment-Based Structure**: Transforms prompts into code comments (using `//` prefix) which Copilot responds to better
- **Language Specification**: Adds explicit language references (e.g., "Use TypeScript") to get more precise results
- **Function Framing**: Structures requests as function implementations to leverage Copilot's strength in code generation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Formats prompts to match patterns that trigger Copilot's best code completion capabilities
- **Error Handling Inclusion**: Explicitly requests proper error handling which improves code quality

### Cursor

- **Conversational Format**: Structures prompts in a conversational way that matches Cursor's interactive nature
- **Step-by-Step Requests**: Explicitly asks for explanations alongside code to utilize Cursor's teaching capabilities
- **Multi-File Context**: Includes references to project structure when relevant to leverage Cursor's cross-file understanding
- **Problem Statement Clarity**: Reformats vague requests into clear problem statements that Cursor responds to better
- **Debugging Context**: Adds error context when relevant to utilize Cursor's debugging strengths

### Replit

- **Project Scope Definition**: Frames prompts in terms of complete projects rather than isolated code snippets
- **Tech Stack Specification**: Includes explicit technology choices to guide Replit's project generation
- **Deployment Considerations**: Adds deployment context when relevant to leverage Replit's hosting capabilities
- **Structure Templates**: Provides project structure expectations to get more organized implementations
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes requests for user interaction components when building web applications

### Amazon CodeWhisperer

- **AWS Service Integration**: Adds references to specific AWS services to leverage CodeWhisperer's AWS expertise
- **Security Focus**: Includes explicit security requirements to utilize CodeWhisperer's security scanning features
- **Compliance Framing**: Adds compliance context when relevant to get more secure and compliant code
- **Reference Tracking**: Structures prompts to encourage proper attribution of code sources
- **Service Connection Patterns**: Formats requests to trigger CodeWhisperer's knowledge of AWS connection patterns

### Tabnine

- **Pattern Completion**: Structures prompts to leverage Tabnine's strength in completing code patterns
- **Local Context Awareness**: Formats prompts to utilize Tabnine's ability to learn from local codebase
- **Consistent Style Matching**: Emphasizes style consistency to work with Tabnine's pattern recognition
- **Short Completion Focus**: Optimizes for Tabnine's strength in line and block completions rather than full functions
- **Naming Conventions**: Emphasizes clear function and variable names to help Tabnine generate better completions

### Codeium

- **Comment-to-Code Conversion**: Structures detailed comments that Codeium can effectively translate into code
- **Cross-File References**: Includes references to other files when relevant to utilize Codeium's cross-file understanding
- **Documentation Generation**: Frames requests to leverage Codeium's documentation generation capabilities
- **Refactoring Guidance**: Provides clear patterns for refactoring to utilize Codeium's code transformation abilities
- **Example-Based Learning**: Includes examples of desired patterns to help Codeium understand the intended output

## Prompt Analysis Techniques

The optimizer performs several types of analysis on input prompts:

- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies whether the prompt is asking for code generation, explanation, debugging, etc.
- **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluates how complex the requested task is to determine appropriate level of detail
- **Domain Detection**: Identifies specific domains (web dev, data science, etc.) to apply domain-specific optimizations
- **Context Evaluation**: Analyzes any additional context provided to incorporate relevant details
- **Pattern Matching**: Compares the prompt against known effective patterns for each tool

## Optimization Transformations

Based on the analysis, the optimizer applies these transformations:

- **Structure Reformatting**: Reorganizes the prompt into a structure that works best for the target tool
- **Detail Enhancement**: Adds missing details that the tool needs for optimal performance
- **Clarity Improvements**: Rephrases ambiguous language to be more precise and actionable
- **Context Integration**: Weaves additional context into the prompt in the most effective way
- **Tool-Specific Syntax**: Adds syntax elements that trigger the best responses from the specific tool

## Technical Implementation Optimizations

The application itself includes several technical optimizations:

- **Modular Architecture**: Separates tool-specific logic into optimizer modules for easy maintenance
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Includes graceful degradation when the AI service is unavailable
- **Caching Layer**: Implements response caching to improve performance for similar prompts
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses asynchronous processing to handle multiple optimization requests efficiently
- **Extensibility**: Designed to easily add new tools and optimization strategies
